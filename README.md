### Forwarding

_**doing** - iMemex_
- Search - ST(Store&Trail) - Share

_**going**_ `v 1.0.*` - transform[facility]
- `ippad`(IPFS-PSW-PWA-Distributed)
- `browserify/simplify/upgrade` of `jsipfs`, as the `ibipfs.js`, which prefers advanced vanilla JS/ES
- * `ibipfs.js` would be the faithful `frontier` of `jsipfs`, which reasonably gonna includes the `nodejs`, `i` care my bros' only.
- * `ibipfs.js` would like to being a bridge to the quickly drifting distributed world of the `jsipfs`. // Self-evolving?
- * `ibipfs.js` would like to being a `plug&play` wherever possible inside the web/browser.
